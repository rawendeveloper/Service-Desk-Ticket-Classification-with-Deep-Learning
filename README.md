# 🎫 Service Desk Ticket Classification with Deep Learning 📊

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based **Service Desk Ticket Classification** system using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The goal is to automatically classify incoming service desk tickets into predefined categories to assist support teams in managing requests efficiently.

The project is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, and deployed with **Streamlit**, offering an interactive web interface that allows users to upload a service desk ticket and receive instant classification predictions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/service-desk-ticket-classification.git
    
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    cd service-desk-ticket-classification
    
    ```
    
3. Install the required dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    

### Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    streamlit run app.py
    
    ```
    
2. Open the web application in your browser. You will see an interface where you can upload a service desk ticket for classification.
3. Upload a ticket, and the model will predict the category (e.g., hardware, software, network issues, etc.) and display the classification along with the confidence score.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a combination of:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words for better input representation.
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts textual data into numerical vectors for the model to process.
- **Conv1D & MaxPooling Layers**: Convolutional and pooling layers to extract important features from the text.
- **Dropout Layer**: To reduce overfitting during training.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.

The model is trained on a service desk ticket dataset, which includes various ticket types to ensure high accuracy and robustness.

## 🔍 Example

1. Launch the application using Streamlit.
2. Upload a service desk ticket (e.g., a ticket describing a software issue).
3. The application will predict the category (e.g., "Software") and display the probability score.
